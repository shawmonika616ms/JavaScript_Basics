      // The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false.

      // JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

      // for - loops through a block of code a number of times
      // for/in - loops through the properties of an object
      // while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
      // do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true

        document.write(a);
        document.write("<br>");
