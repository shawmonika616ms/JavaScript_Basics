      //  Parent, Child, and Sibling Nodes
      // Any subnode of a given node is called a child node, and the given node, in turn, is the childâ€™s parent. Sibling nodes are nodes on the same hierarchical level under the same parent node. Nodes higher than a given node in the same lineage are ancestors and those below it are descendants.The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships. In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node); Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent); A node can have a number of children; Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent.   Methods are
      // parentNode
      // childNodes[nodenumber]
      // firstChild
      // lastChild
      // nextSibling
      // previousSibling
