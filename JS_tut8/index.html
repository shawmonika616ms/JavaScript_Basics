      // Iteration literally means repetition of a process. So iterative statements are constructs that help us repeat some statements a defined no of times. The different iterative statements available in Javascript are

      // Do While loop
      // While loop
      // For loop


      // Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

      // The While Loop
      // The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

      // Syntax

      // while (condition){
      //     code block to be executed
      // }

      var i=1;
      while(i<=20){
        document.write(i);
        i++;
